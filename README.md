The biased Galton box computer determines where we should break apart a standard binomial distribution to produce an arbitrary distribution of values across a fixed set of bins.

This was written for Scav Hunt 2013.
It is some of the worst python I have ever written: NEVER do the sorts of things that I'm doing here.
OOP may not be the most exciting paradigm, but it has its place.
Sadly, it also extends development time, and Scav pushes you for speed.
This is cool stuff, but it was never finished, polished, or reviewed.

The basic idea is to break apart a binomial distribution to approximate a target distribution (in this case, chi^2 with k=3).
If you build the Galton Box well, you should see the expected distribution, but you'll also have to figure out what I'm doing here and finish the code.
Good luck.
